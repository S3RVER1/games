            <h1> squid game </h1>
            <ol>
                 <li>Gi-hun (player 456) joined the squid games to make money.
                    Once he realised that the games were dangerous he tryid to stop them in Season 2. </li>
                 <p><li>Thanos (player 230) joined the squid games in season 2. 
                  although he saw that the games were dangerous he didnt take it seriously and in red light green light he pushed the front person and said "tag" and they all fell because they were all behind each over.</li></p>  </ol>
               <p><li>Ali saved Gi-hun's life in red light green light when he grabbed Gi-gun from the back when Gi-hun was about to fall down.</li></p>
               <p><li>player 001 was a grandpa with something on his head. He joined the squid games because he wanted to have fun just like when he was a kid no matter the cost, even death. before he died he told Gi-gun that he was the one that made him have fun again and then he thanked him right before he died.</li></p>
                <p> This 4 characters are my favourite out of the squid game.</p>
